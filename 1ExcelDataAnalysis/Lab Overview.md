# Lab Overview

## Scenario
> VanArsdel is a company that manufactures and sells sporting goods. The company has offices in the United States (US) and several other countries. Its sales comprise of US sales and International sales. VanArsdel’s sales come from its owned manufactured products, as well as other manufacturers’ products.

VanArsdel's Canada's office has sent you their sales dashboard for the year 2015 up to the end of June, in form of an Excel file.

The company uses a logical operator in the column/field named isVanArsdel to track whether sales come from their manufactured products or from other manufacturers’ products. The logical operators used includes a “Y” (for Yes) to represent a record (a row in the table) of a sales transaction for a VanArsdel manufactured product and a “N” (for No) to represent a record of a sales transaction for an other manufacturers’ product.

You will use this file to review VanArsdel's sales in Canada.

In this lab, you will explore an Excel report that has a dashboard created using Excel pivot charts and slicers based on data from Excel sheets. You will then extend the dashboard by adding a pivot table and apply conditional formatting to the pivot table.

You want to analyze the percentage of the VanArsdel sales in Canada that come from VanArsdel's manufactured goods, by each State (Province). While the chart "Sales by State" shows an overview of this information, you want to show the exact percentage (to two decimal places) of VanArsdel's sales from VanArsdel's manufactured goods. Remember – VanArsdel sells both their own manufactured goods as well as goods from other manufacturers. Finally, you want to highlight if VanArsdel's "share" of goods sold by manufacturer for that state is less than the overall VanArsdel's "share" for the country.
