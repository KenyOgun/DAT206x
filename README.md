Analyzing and Visualizing Data With Excel
> This course involves learning how to import data from different sources, create mashups between data sources, and prepare data for analysis. After preparing the data, find out how business calculations can be expressed using the DAX calculation engine. See how the data can be visualized and shared to the Power BI cloud service, after which it can be used in dashboards, queried using plain English sentences, and even consumed on mobile devices.

## Week One
*	Setup the lab environment by installing Office applications.
*	Learn how to perform data analysis in Excel using classic tools, such as pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers, on data that is already in a worksheet / grid data.
*	Explore an Excel data model, its content, and its structure, using the Power Pivot add-in. Create your first DAX expressions for calculated columns and measures.

## Week Two
*	Learn about queries (Power Query add-in in Excel 2013 and Excel 2010), and build an Excel data model from a single flat table.
*	Learn how to import multiple tables from a SQL database, and create an Excel data model from the imported data.
*	Create a mash-up between data from text-files and data from a SQL database.

## Week Three
*	Get the details on how to create measures to calculate for each cell, filter context for calculation, and explore several advanced DAX functions.
*	Find out how to use advanced text query to import data from a formatted Excel report. Perform queries beyond the standard user interface.

## Week Four
*	Explore ways to create stunning visualizations in Excel. Use the cube functions to perform year-over-year comparisons.
*	Create timelines, hierarchies, and slicers to enhance your visualizations. Learn how Excel can work together with Power BI.
*	Upload an Excel workbook to the Power BI service. Explore the use of Excel on the mobile platform.
